# Udacity-Project-I
One of the projects performed during the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Programme
Using Python through jupyter notebooks various analysis were peformed as projects to fulfill the requirements for the course.

## Twitter Dogs
### Dataset
> WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.
For this case study, the data source comes off the back of Twitter specifically using an API to get raw data. **The raw data archive is [here](https://github.com/mr-williams/Udacity-Project-I/blob/main/Twitter%20Dogs/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)

### Summary of Findings
> The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data in its current state at 2356 rows. The file used was the [twitter-archive-enhanced.csv] file. This was imported using pandas. Assesing the data, shown below are the various quality issues as well as the untidiness found across the 3 datasets. All three were merged to create a singular data set containing as much cleaned information as possible. This file was built off a neural network and is used to classify the dog breeds.
> **The analysis for the project was done (here)[https://github.com/mr-williams/Udacity-Project-I/blob/main/Twitter%20Dogs/wrangle_act.ipynb]
